<h1>This a AirBnB Clone Project</h1>
<p>The ALX-Holberton B&B sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at the ALX-Holberton School - the fullstack software engineering program. The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
	</li>
	<li>
		A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
	</li>
	<li>
		A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
	</li>
	<li>
		An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
	</li>
</ul>
